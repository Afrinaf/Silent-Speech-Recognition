Slient Speech Recognition : Automatic Lip reading Model using 3D CNN and GRU

The proposed project aims to develop an advanced lipreading model that can effectively convert lip 
movements into text, benefiting individuals with hearing impairments and situations where audio 
information is compromised. The proposed solution to the challenge of "Silent Speech Recognition: 
Automatic LipReading Model using 3D CNN and GRU" aims to create an advanced system that can 
recognize speech from lip movements without requiring audible audio input. This technology has various 
potential applications, such as aiding individuals with speech impairments, enhancing speech recognition 
in noisy environments, and enabling silent communication in sensitive situations like security and 
surveillance. 
The advanced lipreading model can be integrated into assistive devices for individuals with hearing 
impairments, providing them with a more effective means of communication. 
This model's successful implementation addresses the challenge of converting lip movements into text 
accurately and reliably. It offers a practical and valuable solution for individuals with diverse applications 
in scenarios where audio information may be limited or compromised
